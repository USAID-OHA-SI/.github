We work in USAID's [Office of HIV/AIDS](https://www.usaid.gov/global-health/health-areas/hiv-and-aids), which support the interagency work of the [President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Releif (PEPFAR)](https://www.state.gov/pepfar/)

The `USAID-OHA-SI` GitHub Organization is a collection of analytic and [package](https://usaid-oha-si.github.io/tools/) repos that our data scientist and analysts use in our every day work with [PEPFAR](https://data.pepfar.gov/) and other data sources. Most of the data we work with are not publically available, so you will largely only find the code behind our work, rather than the input and outputs (data, reports, and visuals). 

You can find out more about our work on our [blog](https://usaid-oha-si.github.io/learn/) or puruse our [data visualization style guide](https://issuu.com/achafetz/docs/oha_styleguide).
